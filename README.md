Clone the repository

```
git clone https://github.com/urm123/library_manager.git
```

Change to the repository directory

```
cd library_manager
```

Run composer to install any PHP dependencies

```
composer install
```

Change to the public directory

```
cd public
```

Start the PHP server (127.0.0.1 is the default route, this makes PHP listen on all IPv4 interfaces)

```

Visit the IP address (127.0.0.1 if you are running Windows/Linux natively, or the IP address of your VM/VPS/etc) http://127.0.0.1:8000 in your web browser.
